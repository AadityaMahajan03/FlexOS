# 🌟 **Flex OS: A Universal Operating System for Everyone**  
**HackOverflow 3.0 Submission**  

Welcome to **Flex OS**, a revolutionary operating system designed to **bridge the digital divide** and empower **everyone**—regardless of age, literacy, or physical ability—to use computers with ease. This project is our submission for **HackOverflow 3.0**, and we’re excited to present a solution that addresses a critical social problem: **unequal access to technology**.  

---

## 🌍 **The Problem**  
Today, computers are essential tools for education, work, and communication. However, not everyone can use them effectively:  
- **Physically challenged individuals** struggle with traditional input methods.  
- **Illiterate individuals** find it hard to navigate text-based interfaces.  
- **Elderly individuals** often face difficulties with complex interfaces.  
- **Young children** lack the experience to use computers efficiently.  

This creates a **digital divide**, leaving millions of people unable to benefit from technology.  

---

## 🚀 **Our Solution: Flex OS**  
Flex OS is a **universal operating system simulation** designed to provide an **inclusive and seamless computing experience** for everyone. Whether you’re a **5-year-old child**, a **50-year-old adult**, a **literate or illiterate person**, or a **specially-abled individual**, Flex OS ensures that you can use computers with the **same ease and efficiency**.
